  *The radio would be the finest possible communication apparatus in public life ... if it knew how to receive as well as to transmit, how to let the listener speak as well as hear, how to bring him into a relationship instead of isolating him.*  
  -- Bertolt Brecht, 1932

Full-spectrum dominance, is a military entity's achievement of control over all dimensions of the battlespace, effectively possessing an overwhelming diversity of resources in such areas as terrestrial, aerial, maritime, subterranean, extraterrestrial, psychological, biological, or cyber-technological, in order to permit the conduct of joint operations without effective opposition or prohibitive interference.

**Describe the main ideas, concepts and / or concerns in your general work (100 words)**
Generally speaking, my work deals with communication, and the tools that we use to mediate these communications. From spoken to written, to mass produced, our communication interfaces have never been neutral of biases toward particular uses and ideologies. Now, that most of our communications happen over digital tools and interfaces, it’s no different. And as we further our reliance on these technologies, how can we maintain agency over our communications? What technological, social and conceptual tools are needed to strengthen and legitimize new forms of occupation and appropriation of these virtual spaces?

**Give a short outline of the project you propose for the Impakt Works residency (150 words)**
This is a proposal for a generative communication system that promotes the occupation of public spaces by creating songs of protest from the recontextualization of geo-located messages from social networking sites.

The project consists of a database of song lyrics whose grammatical structure will be pre-analyzed using neural network algorithms and used to train classifiers. Then, an online system will scrape twitter and other networking sites for messages of dissent and general discontent at a given location, and also use neural network algorithms to analyze the content and structure of these messages. Then, in a final stage, another program will combine the 2 kinds of data to make texts that have the structure of the songs, but words from the public messages.

The new songs will then be sung out loud by text-to-speech synthesis systems installed in public places.

**How does the project you propose relate to your previous work (100 words)**
It is inspired by the public demonstrations that happened throughout Brazil in 2013, and the government's attempt to regulate the use of public spaces. Specifically, it plays with the ambiguities that arise when trying to define social behavior in dense urban areas, where everyday activities are already violent and chaotic.

Like some previous work, this project addresses forms of resistance to established power and pre-established channels of legitimization. It asks how technology can be used to legitimize uses of public spaces, and if physical spaces can be used to resignify and give relevance to virtual communications.

Thiago was a resident from late May until mid July of 2015, and during that time he further developed some tools and concepts for something he calls “Full Spectrum Citizenship”; a term he uses to describe different ways of occupying physical and virtual spaces using technology. More specifically, Thiago developed a generative system that creates and transmits songs of protest. The project consists of a database of song lyrics whose grammatical structure has been analyzed and categorized, and an online system that scrapes Twitter and other social networking sites for messages of dissent and general discontent at a given location. Custom software is then used to combine these two kinds of data to make texts that use the structure of the songs, but have words from the public messages. These new songs are then sung out loud by text-to-speech synthesis systems and broadcast using a short-range FM transmitter. Thiago spent his time developing the software for this system and experimenting with different kinds of transmitter circuits.


On Tuesday 14 July Thiago Hersan will close off his residency at Impakt with an event revolving around two central threads in his work: communications & communities.

From analogue to digital, from custom made to mass produced: our communication interfaces have never been entirely neutral or free of biases toward particular uses. They always reflect the agendas and ideologies of the groups who control and design them.

How can we maintain agency over our communications now that most of it happens over digital tools and our reliance on these technologies increases?

Thiago Hersan (BR-US) uses technological, social and conceptual tools to strengthen and legitimise new forms of occupation and appropriation of virtual spaces of communication. He is currently working on a radio that creates and transmits its own songs of protest based on traditional Brazilian music, and texts used on social media during the 2013/2014 manifestations.
