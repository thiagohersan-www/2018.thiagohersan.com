**Motivations**
As we keep racing to make our communication devices better, faster and smaller, in an attempt to streamline our interactions, it is not hard to imagine a future where public space has been completely relegated to the virtual. A future where protests, celebrations, civic participation and public communication, all happen over apps and other kinds of standardized digital interfaces.

How can we make sure these virtual communications still impart a sense of uniqueness and specialness for the people involved, and that our personalities don’t get optimized out of our own communication processes?

Can we use physical spaces to give significance to these otherwise commonplace exchanges by creating experiences that live beyond their immediate production/consumption cycle?

**Description**
This project proposal is for a public art installation that promotes a more subtle, but hopefully more satisfying, kind of interaction. It is inspired by a very analog and classic version of an afterimage, namely, the short-term blindness due to oversaturation of the retina that results from having your picture taken with a strong flash. We don’t want to blind anyone; we want to use the FIESP façade to flash simple short-lived patterns and provoke the audience to create their own narratives and meaning from such brief stimulation. In an almost paradoxical attempt to saturate the audience with small amounts of information, we hope to create a different kind of interaction with the participants; one that lasts well after the initial flash has happened.

The interaction will take place through a simple web interface that allows participants to take pictures using their own smartphones. When they access the project’s website they will be prompted to wait for their turn to take a picture, and when it’s their turn, they will be able to take a picture, triggering the façade. This interaction will provide a kind of experiential afterimage, a memory of the special moment when they were in charge of the FIESP display.

Another way for the public to be involved with the project is through a series of workshops that we would like to host during the first week of the festival. During these workshop meetings participants will learn enough programming to be able to design their own flashes, which will get incorporated into the installation.

**Urban Digital Art**
As a public art intervention, this project is a kind of homage to other forms of technology-mediated communications, like architecture and photography. On the one hand, the work is an open platform that invites direct participation and creates an opportunity for playfulness through the use of a simple interface. On the other hand, it has a minimalist sculptural form that nonetheless transforms and reinterprets our urban landscape, and at the same time exists apart from any cliches associated with the new aesthetics of digital art. It is an experience, without being a spectacle.

Also, transforming the FIESP building into a telematic object will give participants the unique opportunity to interact with the Paulista landscape using a channel that acts at the scale of the surrounding architecture.
