  *If philosophy hasn't evolved ... it is because our language has remained the same and keeps seducing us into asking the same questions.*  
  -- Ludwig Wittgenstein
</div>

Given the complex relationships that humans have nowadays with both “natural” systems (as evidenced by global warming), and engineered systems (internet as surveillance), how can we avoid the anthropocentric error of always measuring these articulations against the arbitrariness of human linguistic signs? Shouldn't we at least consider alternative modes of representation where the division between human and nonhuman agents don’t make as much sense as they used to?

This project is an investigation into the possibilities of nonhuman semiotics in various aesthetic configurations. The real medium and subject of the project is the nonhuman poetry of algorithms. Its evolution, from abstract instructions for impossible machines to systems that can analyze other systems, shows how we participate, speculate, evolve and intra-act with parallel vocabularies that have become complex enough to beg for their own grammatical demarcations.

The project challenges the notions of what it means to signify, and in what agential configurations these significations manifest themselves. In this kind of entangled storytelling, who "speaks"?

The project explores a different languages for revealing the desires, memories and inner conversations of objects, in an attempt to understand how they shape the construction of their own worlds, and in turn, ours.

### TECHNOLOGY

  *Our Age of Anxiety is, in great part, the result of trying to do today's jobs with yesterday's tools.*  
  -- Marshall McLuhan

In the beginning of the 2000’s, many social psychologists were optimistic about the benefits of mobile communication. There was evidence that suggested that using mobile texting was actually promoting tighter social bonds in the [“fast-paced modern world”](http://www.sirc.org/publik/gossip.shtml){:target="_blank"}. And then came facebook, twitter... and other interfaces that promote incessant, unilateral broadcasting instead of the “social cultivation” that was seen as positive by the psychologists.

At the same time, phones developed a complete and complex arsenal of sensing capabilities: cameras, GPS, accelerometers, NFC, Bluetooth, 2G/3G/4G, and 3D mapping capabilities. With this, it seems like the capacity for interaction (cognitive, physical) was transferred from humans to phones. We became the legs that took them around while they evolved a parallel language.

Understanding and extending this language is, of course, extremely important for military/intelligence agencies and the market, and this is why today we see so many investment initiatives for Smart Cities and Internet of Things technologies. And, the next logical step is to move some of these technologies closer to and into our bodies, so we can more efficiently consume and take our phones around.

I used phones here as a metonym for the technologies explored by this project: the nonhuman poetry of networks (Internet of Things, distributed algorithms), the systems used to interpret these languages (Neural Networks, Big Data algorithms), and the more conceptual challenge of posthumanism (autonomous systems, AI algorithms).


### CULTURE

  *Not even the elite are aware of the biases of the media and technologies they are using to control everyone. That’s why they’re getting such unpredictable results.*  
  -- Douglas Rushkoff (2011)

On one hand, this project is about the non-commonsensical metaphysics of speculative realism and other philosophies that favor non-anthropocentric ontologies and the belief that existence is not intrinsically correlated with human thought or perception.

On the other hand, it questions the biases of our digital communication technologies, and make us think about the limitations implicit in any of the technologies that we use to express ourselves (written, physical, digital).

Culturally speaking, algorithms are at the center of the latest golden age of technocratic idealism. Data is not just a part of today’s commons anymore, it’s becoming its currency: literally, figuratively, socially. Good things shall come to those who share, like, post, poke, trend, pin, tweet… 

One of the most complex issue concerning our networked society today is media literacy. We share about 8 billion “things” on facebook everyday, and upload twenty hours of video to youtube, every minute. We've been weaning on systems that turned us into products that could be sold, and what's being sold is the ability to be manipulated.

Fake news is itself fake news when we realize that the only reason it exists is because it is extremely profitable for a couple of companies that use algorithms to "organize" our huge amounts of data into false, but click-worthy, narratives.
