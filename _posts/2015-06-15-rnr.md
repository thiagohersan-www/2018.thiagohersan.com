Three songs with the same name, but by different artists and genres, are processed by custom software that analyzes and orders their samples by numeric value.

This is part of a project where songs are recreated from different songs with the same name, by sorting and reordering their samples. It references certain cultural tensions in the "borrowing" of R&B songs in the construction of Rock and Roll.

There are only so many values for each sample, so instead of sending you a copy of an audio file I can send you recipes for reorganizing one of your files into other songs. Does this make this kind of metadata more expressive than the data itself?
