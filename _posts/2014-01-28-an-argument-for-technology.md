Inspired by the exhibition's theme of technological afterglow, this project made during [Art Hack Day](http://www.arthackday.net/events/afterglow){:target="_blank"} - [Transmediale](http://www.transmediale.de/){:target="_blank"}, hints at a future where not only we have become disillusioned with technology, but also superfluous in its operation.

A future where we've successfully been able to optimize ourselves out, and technology is capable of communicating with itself using the leftovers of our digital affections.

In this particular instance, a megaphone and a computer monitor discuss the aftermath of their relationship and existence using fatalistic texts scraped from search engines and social networking sites.
