Project done with the [Interspecifics](http://www.interspecifics.cc/){:target="_blank"} collective.

Geobacter Micropulse is a sound spatialization system controlled by patterns generated from voltage variations in microbial fuel cells. The system selects different synthesizer sounds and channel configurations based on a machine learning recognition system written in Python and running on a Raspberry Pi. This produces a kind of graphic score that is generated autonomously and in real time.
